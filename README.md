# odin-recipes

The current project "odin-recipes" is my first project working with html. It is to put the things ive learned using odin to the test.
The skills that will be demonstrated are using html properties to create a homepage with a head, then some body elements and probably using some links to other directories.
Adding some images will be apart of the project.
