        <h2>Desription</h2>
        <p>This pasta salad is nice and colorful, easy to make, and great for summer picnics or parties. The recipe was given to me by a dear friend many years ago, and I've been making it ever since!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta: This colorful, top-rated pasta salad starts with one pound of tri-colored spiral pasta. </li>
            <li>Dressing: Use a bottle of store-bought Italian-style dressing or, if you want to go the extra mile, make your own at home. </li>
            <li>Seasoning mix: Salad seasoning mix lends tons of savory flavor. </li>
            <li>Vegetables: You'll need cherry tomatoes, three bell peppers (green, yellow, and red), and a can of black olives. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and drain the pasta. </li>
            <li>Whisk the dressing with the seasoning mix. </li>
            <li>Combine the pasta with the vegetables, then toss in the seasoned dressing.</li>
