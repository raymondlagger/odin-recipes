        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These boneless wings are a great way to have chicken. I had these at a pub and fell in love with the taste. They're a nice change from your regular chicken wings. Serve with blue cheese dressing for dipping.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
            <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip each piece of chicken in egg mixture, then roll in flour mixture. Repeat so that each piece of chicken is double-coated. Refrigerate breaded chicken for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken in hot oil in batches. Cook until golden brown and juices run clear, 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine hot sauce and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat sauce in the microwave until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Pour sauce over fried chicken; mix to coat.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
